# What is Zig?

Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining robust, optimal and reusable software.

## ⚡ A Simple Language

Focus on debugging your application rather than debugging your programming language knowledge.

* No hidden control flow.
* No hidden memory allocations.
* No preprocessor, no macros.

## ⚡ Comptime

A fresh approach to metaprogramming based on compile-time code execution and lazy evaluation.

* Call any function at compile-time.
* Manipulate types as values without runtime overhead.
* Comptime emulates the target architecture.

## ⚡ Maintain it with Zig

Incrementally improve your C/C++/Zig codebase.

* Use Zig as a zero-dependency, drop-in C/C++ compiler that supports cross-compilation out-of-the-box.
* Leverage zig build to create a consistent development environment across all platforms.
* Add a Zig compilation unit to C/C++ projects; cross-language LTO is enabled by default.
