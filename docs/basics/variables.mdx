```bash title="Syntax"
<keyword> <name> : <type> = <value>
```

```zig  title="~/example"
var foo: i8 = 0;
```

### Keyword

We have two ways how we can declare the variable:
- `var` - declares a mutable variable, which means that the value can be changed at any time;
- `const` - declares a immutable variable, which means that the value can be set once and cannot be change;

### Name

Any name would you like

### Type

Type is a type annotation for identifier, and may be omitted if the data type of value can be inferred.

## Examples

### Var

We can replace value of varibale that was defined with `var` keyword:

```zig  title="~/example"
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
  const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();
  var i: i16 = 0;

  i += 1;
  
  try stdout.print("{d}\n", .{i});
}
```

```bash title="~/example via ↯ v0.11.0 took 4s"
➜ zig run main.zig
1
```

### Const

If we try to reasign the value of variable that was defined with the `const` keyword we will get an error:

```zig title="~/example"
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() !void {
  const stdout = std.io.getStdOut().writer();
  const i: i16 = 0;

  i += 1;

  try stdout.print("{d}\n", .{i});
}
```

```bash title="~/example via ↯ v0.11.0 took 6s"
➜ zig run main.zig
example.zig:7:5: error: cannot assign to constant
  i += 1;
